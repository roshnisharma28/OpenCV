## Introduction

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library that offers tools for real-time computer vision. This course introduces essential functions for image handling, manipulation, and simple computer vision tasks like edge detection, color conversions, and contouring.

## Features

- Read, display, and save images
- Perform basic image manipulations (resizing, cropping, color conversions)
- Draw shapes and text annotations on images
- Apply various image filters and edge detection methods
- Detect and visualize contours

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Use the following command to install all necessary libraries, including `opencv-contrib-python`, `caer`, `numpy`, `pandas`:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python caer numpy pandas

## Basic Concepts

-Reading Images and Video 
-Resizing and Rescaling Images 
-Drawing Shapes and Placing text on images
-Essential Methods in OpenCV 
-Rotating an image
-Contour Detection

## Advanced Concepts

-Colour Spaces (RGB, BGR, Grayscale, HSV and Lab) 
-Bitwise operations
-Blurring
